QuatroMiner is the perfect companion to your NerdMiner, a popular Bitcoin mining software that runs on the compact and powerful Lilygo T-Display ESP32-S3 microcontroller. This remarkable device might operate on the principle of a lottery, offering a slim chance of success, but when it hits the jackpot, it really pays off 6.25 BTC.
